This project is the final implementation of Tetris game. This project is to make the Tetris game be able to play. In this project we implemented the canMove, isFree, isValid, addToBoard, moveBlocksdown, check rows and checkEndGame functions. We makes the tetrimono object stop falling when it reaches the bottom. We also make the object fall as far as it can immediately when the space bar is pressed. The program also determine the end game when the object reaches the top. We also ensure that the tertrimono will not move out of the play area by any means. We all contributed with getting the different functions and the game panel up and running and then we fixed some bugs that occurs in our program.

User instructions: First time running the program will randomly display one of the 7 Tetris shapes on the top. Use left key to move the Tetris left, use right key to make it move right. Down key will make it move down faster and use up key to rotate 90 degrees clockwise. We can also pause the game using key P and continue the game by pressing key P one more time. The object will fall down immediately when the space bar is pressed. It will also eliminate a row when you make a full row.  The game will end if the object reaches the top.
